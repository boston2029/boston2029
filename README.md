- 👋 Hi, I’m @boston2029
- 👀 I’m interested in mainly ways that a everyday object can interact with a computer. (Like IoT, but not like Smart Homes, just simply when you touch something and the computer knows)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning nothing much
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing.
- 📫 How to reach me... Discord is cyclSdis.
